# About

The project started off as an optimisation for the existing trace.moe project.
Reducing resource usage and improving search query results to milliseconds.

#### Origin of the name
The name **Wayori** comes from Japanese: „Åì„ÅÆ„Ç∑„Éº„É≥„ÅØ‰ΩïË©±„Çà„Çä (kono shƒ´n wa nan-**wa yori**). Meaning which episode does this scene come from. So the name pronounces as wa-yori, not way-ori.
